# Time Series Resampling Function

## Motivation

In numerous experiments involving physical systems, a prevalent challenge is the occurrence of sampling issues. Such discrepancies can prove troublesome, particularly when the data is required to be evenly spaced for applications reliant on uniform time series, like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Recognizing the significance of this issue, a simple yet effective Python function/tool was developed. It is cherished by its creator for its utility in addressing the uneven sampling of data, underscoring the practical necessity to adapt and preprocess data for specific analytical needs.

## Description

This Python function/tool serves as a practical solution for resampling time series data to a specified frequency. It elegantly tackles the problems posed by unevenly sampled data, ensuring that the resultant time series are evenly spaced. This process not only facilitates smoother integration with models and systems requiring uniform input but also enhances the overall quality and reliability of the data analysis.
